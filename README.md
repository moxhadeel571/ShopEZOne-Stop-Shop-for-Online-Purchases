## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ShopEZ.git

Prerequisites:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your development machine:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Spring Boot applications require Java. Install the latest version of the JDK. You can download it from the official Oracle or OpenJDK website.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can use popular IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code for Spring Boot development. Ensure you have your preferred IDE installed and set up.

Maven or Gradle: Spring Boot projects are often managed with either Maven or Gradle. Choose one, and ensure it's installed.

Installation Steps:
Clone the Repository:

Clone your project repository to your local development machine using Git. Replace repository-url with the actual URL of your Git repository.

bash

git clone repository-url
Open the Project in Your IDE:

Open your project in your chosen IDE. Most modern IDEs have built-in support for Spring Boot projects, making it easier to manage dependencies, build, and run the application.

Build the Project:

If you're using Maven, you can build the project by running the following command in your project's root directory:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
If you're using Gradle, use the following command:

bash

gradle clean build
Run the Application:

Start your Spring Boot application from your IDE. You can typically do this by right-clicking on your main application class (usually annotated with @SpringBootApplication) and selecting "Run" or "Debug."

Alternatively, you can use Maven or Gradle to run the application from the command line:

Maven:

bash

mvn spring-boot:run
Gradle:

bash
Copy code
gradle bootRun
Access the Application:

Once the application is running, you can access it through a web browser or an API testing tool. By default, Spring Boot applications often run on http://localhost:8080, but this can be configured in your application.properties or application.yml file.

Database Configuration (If Applicable):

If your Spring Boot application uses a database, ensure that you have configured the database connection properly in your application.properties or application.yml file.
